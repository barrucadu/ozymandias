Ozymandias
==========

> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

Ozymandias is my attempt to build a decentralised container scheduler,
built on top of:

- [etcd][]: to store cluster state
- [podman][]: to run the pods
- [flannel][]: to provide the pod network
- [coredns][]: to provide name resolution

There's no documentation here yet, but you can find a broad overview
in [my weeknotes][].

I'll probably get bored of this and abandon it before it gets very far.

[etcd]: https://etcd.io/
[podman]: https://podman.io/
[flannel]: https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/
[coredns]: https://coredns.io/
